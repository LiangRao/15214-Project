#### Correctly applying the concepts of polymorphism and information hiding (20/20)

Your implementation effectively demonstrates your understanding of polymorphism and information hiding. Well done!


* Polymorphism (15/15)
* Information Hiding (5/5)

#### Java best practices and compatibility with our informal specification (29/30)

Your implementation does not fully match our specification:


* Part 1: Calculator Operations (8/8)
* Part 2: Expressions (9/9)
* Part 3: Derivatives (12/13)

  * Your `zero()` method does not restore your variable to its original value. This may result in unexpected results when evaluating other expressions using the same variable. [Medium]

#### Unit testing, including coverage and compliance with best practices (/30)

Your solution effectively demonstrates your proficiency in testing. Well done!

You achieved 100% line coverage

* Testing (12/12)
* Coverage (12/12)
* AvlTree (6/6)

#### Documentation and style (20/20)
