hw4c Feedback
============


#### Design of GUI and Special Tile Implementation (30/30)

* Your implementation effectively separates the GUI from the Core. 
  * You should put the GameListener interface as it doesn't depend on the GUI implementation

* Your implementation seems to completely implement the additional special tile in an extensible way. Nice job!

#### Implementation of GUI (37/40)

* Your GUI contains all the key pieces of information we would expect to see while playing Scrabble.

* Your GUI contains most of the key aspects of Scrabble gameplay, but we identified the following minor issues:
  * The player challenged did not have its next turn forfeited when a challenge succeeded

* Build automation using gradle and Travis CI seems to work fine, but we were unable to start your game using `gradle run`.

* Your implementation meets our expectations regarding documentation and style.


#### Reflection on the design process (5/10)

  * You did not update your `rationale.pdf`
